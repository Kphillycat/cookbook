Write a small rails app that incorporates angularjs to do the following:
provide a simple rails CRUD interface for entering recipes, each of which includes:
  a name
  a description
  a list of ingredients, each of which includes:
    a unit
    a quantity
    a name
  preparation instructions

- on the view screen for a recipe, use angularjs to allow a user to scale the recipe allow for 0.5x increments, from 0.5 to 5

extra credit:
  allow the user to enter/c&p an entire list of ingredients into a free-flowing text box, and parse them out!  super-slick!
prettiness optional - wonâ€™t be graded on style but it is always apprecaited.
